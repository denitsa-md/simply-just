This internship was my first real-world introduction to programming. I made some improvements to the landing page and fixed small things in the backend which was built with Java (Spring framework). The landing page has since changed a lot. What I had coded was rather primitive but seemed like rocket science at that point. I was dipping my toes into CSS and did not know what an AJAX request was, so there was a lot of learning involved with just looking around the codebase and trying to make sense of how things are connected.  

I also had a chance to make use of my Bachelor in Business Administration as I was involved in preparing the application for a grant the company wanted to apply for. Among other things, this involved exploring the existing market, laying out the competitive advantages of the product, and putting that in writing for the application.
