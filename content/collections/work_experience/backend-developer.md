Towards the end of my Bachelor degree in Business Administration I developed an interest in programming and went on to a Masters degree in Software development. I spent a year doing that and then was lucky to be given a chance by SubscriptionPeople to work with programming professionaly. That's where I've been since 2016.

**ConsortiaManager**

The first system I worked on was [ConsortiaManager](https://consortiamanager.com/) - a workflow and ERM tool for library consortia, used by customers around the world. I started out as a junior developer, learning the ropes and the domain of libraries and consortia. In the beginning I fixed small bugs and made small improvements. I was then assigned bigger features: a customizable dashboard for the library interface in the system; a shopping basket where libraries can add the resources they wish to purchase from the consortium; a dashboard for the consortia, summarising library activity (from Google analytics) among others. I did both backend and frontent work.

**ROAM**

Towards the end of 2017, the idea for a new product crystalized - a workflow tool with the individual library in focus. I was tasked with taking the lead on the project and developing [ROAM](https://roam.plus/) (Research Output and Acquisitions Management).

ConsortiaManager was initially built as a pilot project for a single customer, on top of a custom PHP framework. Scaling that to support an increasing number of customers posed many challenges. We had a colleague at the time who had worked with Laravel and we made the decision to create the new application with that. I spent the next month getting into the framework (having never worked with an official framework before) and slowly diving into the development of the new system.

At the start of the project, I spent a lot of time collecting requirements. I was the sole developer at the time and it took about half a year until we had some functionality that enabled us to make a simple demo.

Ever since, we have been improving the system, expanding the ROAM team, and attracting new customers. We now have a dedicated frontend developer, a designer, and an additional backend developer.

The application has been transformed into a single page app and I am now solely responsible for the backend API, infrastructure, and deal with a lot of the project management work. Since the start from the project, I have greatly improved my skills both as a developer, but also as a team player.

Aside from coding, I have also been heavily invested in improving our processes and workflow, introducing principles from agile methodologies that make sense for our small team.
